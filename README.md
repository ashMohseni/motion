<h3>This is the source code for the Motion Controller game</h3>

The game's layout is done using **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. Motion Controller has been created using the [ZIM JavaScript Canvas Framework](https://zimjs.com).
**ZimJs** is an open-source library and you can check its repository out from [here](https://github.com/danzen/zimjs).


In the game, there is one square, and one circle at the bottom, 
and the same on the right side of the screen. You have to **control both sides only by moving your mouse around** !! 
Also, keep in mind that every time you hit the wrong object, you'll lose that object.
